  aBrain is the first rapid prototyping environment for Android devices. Through a scripting interface you can directly start coding with the included hardware and software features.
  <br /><br />
  My primary development target is to keep it simple for you! Things like speed and stability are only secondary and will be considered later (if I could work full time on the project ;-) ).
<br /><br />
To enable a easy development workflow aBrain includes two tools: 
<ol>
  <li>Editor: create your scripts</li> 
  <li>Monitor: supervise the execution</li>
</ol>
Both are designed as platform independent web app and can be used from any device over network.

  <span class="md-title">Recommendations</span><br />
  <ul>
    <li>use always the latest version of Google Chrome</li>
    <li>if you use the web application directly from you aBrain running device, you can connect via localhost:8080/.. (even if your device is offline)</li>
    <li>for connection over mobile network you will need a VPN solution</li>
  </ul>
